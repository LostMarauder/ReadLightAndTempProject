Connected Particle Photon to VM.

Have particle-cli install on VM, and run command:

particle serial list

Note that this will give the device name of the Photon.


Run this command to output the data from serial to the terminal:

sudo particle serial monitor /dev/devXXX


The python script will create a new sqlite database and a data table in the database.
This data table will be updated continuously as long as the script is running. The 
database file is created and stored in the same directory as the python script.

The script has been modified to use a config file for the device and database parameters.

Image data collection code was commented out. The image collection should be re-enabled
once they can be stored onto the same database as the light and temperature data.
